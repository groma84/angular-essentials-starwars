# AngularEssentialsStarwars
My code-along of the udemy [Angular Essentials](https://www.udemy.com/angular-essentials-angular-2-angular-4-with-typescript/learn/v4/overview) course.
It queries the [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) for Star Wars Character stuff and allows you to define and switch characters from the Dark Side to the Light Side and vice versa.
